background: |
    [ELIXIR France](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/france) with the support of the [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/) Hub and the ELIXIR interoperability platform and in collaboration with [COST](http://www.cost.eu/about_cost) CHARME, the National Bioscience Database Center ([NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/)) and the Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en/)), is organising a BioHackathon in November 2018 in Paris. This BioHackathon will complement and work in collaboration with the BioHackathon planned in Japan at the end of 2018.
scope: |
    The topics of this BioHackathon will go beyond semantics and interoperability, which are typically predominant in the BioHackathons organised in Japan. The priority topics will be defined by ELIXIR platforms (data, tools, compute, interoperability and training), ELIXIR communities (eg. metabolomics and proteomics), a selection of new tools and communities (eg. Cytoscape and reproducible networks) proposed by ELIXIR France, and common challenges proposed for the sister BioHackathon organised in Japan.
